# README

I've uploaded the Jupyter notebook I used to clean the data. The data file it takes in is a csv file downloaded from a Kaggle competition called "car_price_prediction.csv" that resides in the data folder.

I've converted this Jupyter notebook into multiple Python scripts that are reusable and modular to mimic production code. The main script "main.py" loads various functions from "load_data.py" and "clean_transform_data.py", and finally outputs the clean csv file called "car_price_prediction_clean_pipeline.csv" that resides in the data folder.
